# Planning_a_Vacation
We recently went on a 4-day vacation to Edinburgh, Scotland. To make sure we got to do everything we wanted to do, we marked out all of the places we wanted to go to, on an interactive map in Google Colab. This code will show you how we did it so that you can do it to!

To actually view the map, download the notebook and open it through Google Colab.
